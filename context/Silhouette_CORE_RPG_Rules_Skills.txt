ACTION: HEAVY GEAR
Introduction
Before sitting down to actually roleplay, players
will have to create their characters. The
characters can be almost any type of person
that fits the background of the campaign. The
process outlined in the following pages
assumes characters above the average, but
still far from the level of the elites. This can be
adjusted to better accommodate the style
intended for the game, be it gritty or cinematic.
The characters are going to be the conduit
through which the players interact with the
game world. They will, as mentioned in section
1.1, be the heroes of the story that will be told
through playing the game. The characters can
be pure or flawed and their motivations may
differ, but it doesn’t matter as long as they are
interesting to control and watch. And
remember, all characters can grow further
through experience, adding new abilities and
contacts.
In order to keep the basic character generation
rules as clear and concise as possible, a
number of advanced options (such as Special
Abilities, which are “super” Perks and alien
race design rules) have been placed in
Chapter Six. They follow the same point
spending rules, but their use is restricted to
certain types of campaigns — the
Gamemaster and players should confer
together to see what will be allowed.
The important thing to remember is that there
is no right or wrong way to do things, as long
as the point-spending rules are respected. The
player is in complete charge of the design
decisions — no one is forced to purchase a
certain Skill, unless they are required for the
campaign (a game about a squadron of fighter
pilots will obviously need characters who can
pilot planes). Examine each choice closely,
remembering that all characters have potential
strong points.

Appearance (APP)
Appearance rates the physical attractiveness
of the character. This can modify how other
people react to him: many heroic characters
have a high Appearance rating in order to
impress those they come in contact with. Note
that Appearance applies solely between
members of the same race.
2.1 Attributes
The basic abilities, knowledge and
weaknesses of a character are defined by their
Attributes. These largely represent the
characteristics a character was born with, or
acquired in their formative years. These range
from physical Attributes, such as Agility and
Fitness, to mental proficiencies such as
Willpower and Knowledge. The ten basic
Attributes represent a character’s natural
proficiencies and potential. A character with
high Fitness will tend to be a better athlete,
one with high Influence will gravitate to
leadership positions and so on.
Attributes can be improved through hard work,
but it is very tough and time-consuming. They
can be lowered, but usually this is the result of
awful wounds or advanced age that will likely
retire the character from an active adventuring
life. Attributes, unlike Skills and other abilities,
thus vary little throughout much of a campaign
(see
Character Improvement, section 2.5).
2.1.1 Descriptions
The following texts describe the ten basic
Atributes and their use in the game. Along with
each description, a table giving a real world
equivalent for different ratings is listed.
Attribute levels are based on an average
human person in their young adulthood; some
creatures or aliens may have much more
widely dispersed Attribute ranges. The human
average range is -3 to +3, with Build being the
sole exception.
Agility (AGI)
Agility is the character’s hand-eye
coordination, nimbleness and reflexes. This
Attribute is best suited to action-oriented
characters such as pilots, bodyguards and
pickpockets, all of which are likely to have high
Agility ratings.

Build (BLD)
Build is a rating of the character’s size and
body frame. It does not represent the
character’s physical might — that’s what’s the
Strength Secondary Attribute is for — but the
actual body size and mass. This is most
apparent in the archetypal couch potato who
is very large (high Build), but can barely lift
the remote to change the channel.
Fitness (FIT)
Fitness rates the character’s general flexibility,
cardiovascular endurance, resistance to effort
and overall muscle tone. While Build measures
raw size, Fitness measures how well
maintained the character’s body is. Illness can
temporarily reduce this Attribute, as can other
hardships (such as a substandard air supply
and starvation).

-2 50-59.9 kg
-3 40-49.9 kg
-4 25-39.9 kg
-5 10-24.9 kg
Creativity (CRE)
Creativity is a measure of the character’s ability to
use his mind in innovative ways. It is also a measure
of the character’s ability to think on his feet. This
Attribute is useful for most characters who
are likely to be thrust into unfamiliar
situations and for leaders who have to make
many decisions while on the run.

Influence (INF)
Influence measures the character’s charm, wit
and persuasiveness. A high Influence rating
is a must for any charismatic leader. It is also
useful for those who desire to spend lots of
time in corporate or social settings, or
characters who need to get past security in
more subtle ways.

Knowledge (KNO)
Knowledge is the character’s ability to learn
and recall information and also takes into
account the number of years of education the
character has successfully completed.
Scientists and “brainiac” characters typically
have high Knowledge ratings.
Psyche (PSY)
Psyche is an abstract measure of the
character’s karma, happiness, sensitivity and
love of life.
It also reflects the empathy of the character
and how “in tune” he is with his own emotions
and those of others, as well as his innate
luck. Psyche is an abstract concept
which is best reflected by extremes;
someone with a low psyche seems to
have a black cloud over his head all the
time and people will intuitively avoid him.
A person with a high Psyche is empathic
towards the feelings of others and tends
to be easily trusted.

Perception (PER)
Perception is a measure of the character’s
attentiveness to detail and overall alertness. It
is crucial for action heroes, since the enemy who
cannot be seen cannot be dealt with. Perception
is especially important for scouts and
investigators, who need to pay attention to
obscure details and find things hidden from view.

Willpower (WIL)
Willpower is a rating of the character’s self-
discipline, determination and pain threshold.
Unlike Psyche, Willpower does not imply a love
of life; it does however reflect the character’s
ability to deny death using sheer strength of will.
Headstrong and arrogant characters are good
candidates for a high WIL, as are shocktroopers
who want to be able to take a bullet.

2.1.2 Picking Attributes
Players purchase Attributes to flesh out the
rough mental image of their character. A
certain number of Character Points (CPs) are
available to purchase Attributes. The cost in
CPs of an Attribute rating is listed in the
Attribute Costs table. Purchasing very low stats
“gives back” some CPs. A rating must be
purchased in all ten Attributes. None are truly
more important than the others and all have
their usefulness. If any CPs are left over, each
point becomes one Emergency Die (see
Emergency Dice, section 2.6.2) or a Skill Point,
at the player’s choice.
Joe Average, the man on the street, has only
10 CPs available. This is just enough to
purchase 0 (normal, average Attributes) in all
Attributes. Player characters are heroes, so
they receive a few more points, depending on
the style of play of the campaign chosen by
the GM (see
Reality Distorsion Factors, section
6.4.1, for more details).

Chapter Two:
Character Design
Though normal humans cannot have Attributes
above +3 or below -3, the cost table can be
extended further to accommodate creatures
and alien beings. The point cost is equal to
the Attribute plus one, squared: e.g., +4 would
cost (5 x 5) or 25 points. For negative Attribute,
the cost is the rebate in points: e.g., -4 would
cost (-3 x -3), giving back nine points.
‘Quick Start’ Generation
For rapid generation of a player character in a
standard Adventurous-level Silhouette game,
the character starts with one +2, four +1’s and
five +0’s, placed in the ten basic Attributes as
desired. This accounts for exactly 30 CPs.
Design Notes:
Simplifying Attributes
Ten Attributes were chosen to reflect as many
facets of a character as possible. Some players
prefer to deal with fewer characteristics,
however, in order to spend less time worrying
about the mechanical aspects of the game and
more time on the plot. Luckily, this is possible
by simply
averaging Attributes (rounding
toward zero) that govern similar areas. Some
detail is lost, but game speed is increased.
Six Stats: essentially, a d20 version. See the
OGL conversion guide in Chapter 8.
Five Stats: Alertness (AGI+PER)/2, Body
(BLD+FIT)/2, Intelligence (KNO+CRE)/2,
Charisma (APP+INF)/2, Mind (WIL+PSY)/2.
Strength tests use the new Body Attribute,
Health tests use Mind; Stamina is (5 x
(Body+Mind)/2) x 25. Divide starting CPs in
half, rounded up.
Three Stats: Body (AGI+BLD+FIT)/3, Mind
(CRE+KNO+PER)/3, Spirit (APP+INF+WIL)/3.
PSY is not used, except if magic or other special
powers are required. Strength tests use the Body
Attribute, Health tests use Spirit; Stamina is (5 x
(Body+Spirit)/2) x 25. Divide starting CPs by
three, rounded up.

2.2 Skills
While a character’s Attributes define his
potential, his Skills define his actual abilities.
This section details all the basic Skills
available; Core Player Handbooks may add
more as necessary to cover the requirements
of their individual campaign worlds. Note that
some Skills have a pre-modern version (for use
in fantasy settings, for example).
Gamemasters should feel free to invent new
Skills if they are absolutely required in their
campaign. A new Skill should not be too
general nor too specific —
Shooting is an
example of something too general, as it might
allow any sort of ranged weapon to be used,
while
Identification of Martian Flatworm
Subspecies is definitely too specific.
Skills are used in Skill Tests, where a number
of six-sided dice equal to the Skill level is rolled
and the highest number picked. Modifiers are
then added to the result, including situation
and Attribute modifiers. The latter will vary
according to the task at hand:
Agility-based Skill Tests: These are situations
which require a high degree of hand-eye
coordination and quick reaction times, as well
as those which require precisely controlled
movements of the body.
Appearance-Based Skill Tests: By using a Skill
to accentuate his attractiveness, a character
can modify what other people’s reactions will
be, or, on the other hand, use his looks to boost
the result of a social Skill.
Build-based Skill Tests: Most of the tasks which
are related to Build are innate, not learned, thus
there are few times a Skill test will be called
for this Attribute.
Creativity-based Skill Tests: These are
situations that involve an individual’s ability to
think up new solutions to a problem. An artist
tries to find new ways to entertain his audience;
a lost person tries to make the best he can
with what he has at his immediate disposal; a
commander tries to find a new way to achieve
his mission objectives. All of these show the
ingenuity of an individual under at least
somewhat stressful conditions.
Fitness-based Skill Tests: These are situations
that place high physical stresses upon the
body. Pushing one’s body to the edge has long
been a source of fascination of Humankind.
Influence-based Skill Tests: The natural desires
of people to try and get the most in return for
their work have manifested themselves through
communications of various types for ages. The
ability to convince another person of one’s
ideals without the use of force is now far
preferred to violence by many cultures.
Knowledge-based Skill Tests: These situations
call as much on long study and past
experience as they do on natural aptitude.
Perception-based Skill Tests: These tests rely
on a character’s awareness of his
surroundings, including both actions and
objects. These take into account sight, sound
and possibly other senses such as smell or a
“sixth sense.”
Willpower-based Skill Tests: These are
generally Opposed Skill tests between two
people, to see who will crack first. These tests
are also used when focus on a task is
important.
Psyche-based Skill Tests: The rather ethereal
quality of the Psyche Attribute is reflected in
its tests, with the ability to pick up on the body
language, eye movements and other subtle
signals which people send. What information
this type of test imparts is even more at the
whim of the GM than other types of tests and
players should not rely on it as a lie detector.

2.2.1 Skill Levels
Players should now choose Skills for their
characters with their stock of Skill Points (see
below). The
Skill Costs tables list the Skill point
costs for both Level and Complexity. Starting
Skill Levels and Cpx are generally low, but can
be improved through experience.
2.2.2 Skill Complexity
Complexity was first explained in section 1.2.2
and represents the breadth of knowledge. All
Skills begin with a free Complexity of 1.
Additional levels of Cpx can be purchased at a
cost in Skill Points (see
Skill Complexity Costs
table). A higher Complexity allows the character
to use higher technology or more versatile
tools with his Skill and also provides him
with additional breadth of knowledge that
will make completing a task easier.
Complexity is noted as a second number
after a slash, such as “2/4” for a Skill level
of 2 with a Complexity of 4.
Unless specifically noted in their description,
all Attributes and Skill tests, equipment and
weapons are Complexity 1.
2.2.3 Skill Specialization
A character may obtain a Skill
Specialization at a cost of 5 Skill Points.
This gives the character a +1 modifier to
his Skill test totals under certain
conditions. For example, a soldier could
have a Small Arms Specialization in
“rifles,” and thus add one to every roll
made while using a rifle. A scientist could
have a Physical Sciences Specialization
in nuclear physics and gain the +1
whenever a relevant test is called for. The
Skills section later in this chapter includes
suggested Specializations, but the
Gamemaster and players can add more
should they wish.
A character may purchase multiple
different Specializations in the same Skill,
but no more than one Specialization (i.e.
+1 bonus, maximum) can be applied on
a single die roll. Players may be tempted
to focus their characters at excelling in a
few Skills by purchasing specializations
and high levels in three or four Skills. Quite
often, the advantages of this are more than
offset by the inflexibility of the character, which
will surface whenever the Gamemaster thrusts
him into unfamiliar situations.

On record sheets, Specializations are
usually noted either as a footnote to the
Skill entry or right after it, in parenthesis.
2.2.4 Skill List
In order to make future character
creation easier, only the Skills’ names
are listed in the table on the next page.
Full descriptions can be found in the
reference section at the end of this game
manual.
Skill descriptions have several entries.
The
Attributes entry shows which
Attributes are used for which tasks; note
that this is not an exhaustive list and the
Gamemaster may call on other
Attributes depending on the nature of
the test at hand. The
Specializations
entry lists a few suggestions for Skill
Specializations. The next entry lists
some professions that normally have
some training in the Skill. The final entry
is a short, plain-English description.
Some Skills are noted with a (Specific)
after their name. These Skills cover a
wide field of related abilities that rely on
the same basic knowledge. When
buying one such Skill, a specific field of
expertise must be specified, but the
character can also use the Skill for
situations that fall under the general
header, albeit with a penalty. It is possible to
buy multiple instances of the Skill to cover
multiple fields, if desired (for example, a
scientist with multiple doctorates could have
Natural Sciences (Physical) and Natural
Sciences (Earth), to avoid taking a penalty and
boost them to high levels).
In cinematic games (see section 7.3), where
characters tend to be expert at everything, the
above requirements are waved. The professor
with Natural Sciences is equally adept at
biology, physics and geology.
Design Notes:
Hey, Where’s Skill ‘X’?
A number of Skills were folded together in the
Silhouette revision. Many of them, such as
Acrobatics and First Aid, are now expressed
as an additional Complexity of another Skill.
(If converting an old character, take the folded
Skill’s level and apply it as a free bonus to the
Cpx of the new Skill.) Skills that are not used
often in a typical action game, such as the
various art- and science-related Skills, were
likewise merged together to free up points and
allow well-rounded characters that are useful
outside the lab or workshop.
Hooks & Tips:
Favored Item
When initially purchasing a Skill, a related item
(be it a reference book, weapon, vehicle, etc.)
can be chosen. It is then known as the
character’s “Favored Item,” and only one
favored item is allowed per Skill (it may not be
changed later, either). When using a favored
item, the character may ignore the bad side of
any Fumbles rolled and treat the roll as a result
of one. If the item is lost or destroyed in the
course of an adventure, one Experience Point
(XP) can buy a replacement for future sessions.

2.3 Secondary
Attributes
Secondary Attributes are labeled that way
because they are not selected like the basic
Attributes, but are derived on the latter (and,
in some cases, Skill levels). They represent
facets of the character’s physical and mental
abilities. Unlike the basic Attributes, the
Secondary Attributes can and do vary over the
course of the game to reflect additional Skills
gained, or injuries suffered.
The character’s Secondary Traits, Wound
Thresholds and System Shock are calculated
using the following formulas. Although the
formulas appear involved, most of them are
simply an averaging of two or three Attributes.
Some Traits have minimum values, meaning
this is the lowest value they can have
regardless of Attributes and skills.
2.3.1 Descriptions
The following texts describe the five
Secondary Attributes and their use in the
game. Along with each description, a table
giving a real world equivalent for different
ratings is listed. Attribute levels are based on
an average human person in their young
adulthood; some creatures or aliens will have
more widely dispersed Secondary Attribute
ranges.
Strength (STR)
Strength is a measure of a character’s raw
physical power and brute strength; it is a zero-
average rating. Strength is the average of Build
and Fitness, rounded towards zero. Cross-
indexing with the Build mass table (section
2.1.1) shows the maximum weight that can be
deadlifted and carried a few paces — the
lowest weight value in the corresponding entry
is used. Thus, a character with a +2 Strength
can heft around 95 kg and stagger for a few
steps before running into difficulty. A mass
equal to half the deadlift capacity can be held
above the head and a mass double the deadlift
capacity can be dragged along.
Calculating
Secondary Attributes
Strength = (Build + Fitness) / 2, round
towards zero
Health = (Fitness + Psyche +
Willpower) / 3, round off
Stamina = (5 x (Build + Health)) + 25,
minimum 1
Unarmed Damage = 3 + Strength + Build + Hand-
to-Hand Skill level, minimum 1
Armed Damage = 3 + Strength + Build + Melee
Skill level, minimum 1
Flesh Wound Threshold = Stamina / 2, round up
Deep Wound Threshold = Stamina
Instant Death Threshold = Stamina x 2
System Shock = 5 + Health, minimum 1

Hooks & Tips:
Pushing One’s Strength
Characters may attempt to push their
Strength beyond its normal limits. This lasts
only for the duration of the STR test. Strength
can be pushed by up to +2 for characters
with STR 0 or higher and by +1 for characters
with STR below 0. Characters risk physical
injury when doing this: make a Health
Attribute test vs. a Threshold of 4 for an
additional +1 Strength, or a Threshold of 6
for +2. Failing this roll results in a Light Wound
for the character (torn ligaments, strains,
back pain, etc.); Fumbling it will result in a
Deep Wound (slipped disk, ripped muscle,
etc.). Characters may push their strength as
often as they like, but each additional push
per day (before a full night of sleep) incurs
additional risk of injury: add +2 (cumulative)
to the base Threshold.
Health (HEA)
Health rates a character’s resistance to illness,
toxins and physiological shock; it is a zero-
average rating. Health is the average of Fitness,
Psyche and Willpower, rounded to the nearest
whole number. People who never seem to get
sick and those who can drink large quantities of
alcoholic beverages have a high HEA rating.

Stamina (STA)
Stamina is a rating of how much sheer
physical punishment a character’s body
can tolerate. Unlike many other
Attributes, Stamina is
not a zero-average
rating: it is equal to five times the total
of Build and Health, plus 25. No
character may have a Stamina lower
than 1 (if lower, round up to one). While a high
Stamina will decrease the chances of injury, it
is still quite easy for a character to be wounded
by gunfire or other deadly weapons. Stamina
will be used to work out the Wound Thresholds,
which determine when and if a character gets
hurt (see sections 2.3.3 and 3.5).

STA RATING EQUIVALENT
10 Frail old grandmother, child
15 Young teenager
20 Weak adult
25 Average individual
30 Fitness enthusiast
40 Professional athlete
50 Professional boxer
Unarmed Damage (UD)
Unarmed damage is the Damage
Multiplier of any unarmed (Hand-to-
hand Skill) attacks performed by the
character. It is
not a zero-average rating:
Unarmed Damage is equal to three plus
the total of Hand-to-hand Skill level,
Strength and Build. The minimum
Unarmed Damage rating is 1. This
damage is on the Personal Scale, not
the Vehicle Scale (see section 4.4). The
Damage Multiplier is a reflection of both
how much force a character can put
behind a punch and how well the
character can place the blow.
Armed Damage (AD)
Armed Damage is the base Damage Multiplier
of any of the character’s armed attacks (Melee
Skill). It is
not a zero-average rating: Armed
Damage is equal to three plus the total of Melee
Skill level, Strength and Build. The minimum
Armed Damage rating is 1. The Damage
Multiplier of a melee weapon is equal to the
character’s Armed Damage rating and the
weapon’s own base DM. This damage is on
the Personal Scale, not the Vehicle Scale (see
section 4.4).

Design Notes:
Damage Multipliers
Most game rules include provision on injuries
and damage and Silhouette is no different. In
order to speed up gameplay and avoid
multiple dice rolls for hitting, damaging and
guarding against damage, all this is done in
one fell swoop. The Margin of Success of a hit
is multiplied by the Damage Multiplier of the
attack to yield the total damage; armor and
other protections will be factored into the
Stamina ratings, which are used to determine
wounds. Speed of resolution, always!

Physical Status represents the level of
resistance to physical wounds. There are three
types of injuries. Flesh Wounds are nasty but
not crippling wounds; Deep Wounds are
immediately life-threatening injuries; Instant
Death requires no further explanation.
Each level of injury has an associated
wounding Threshold. Wound Thresholds are
the amount of damage an attack must cause
to produce a certain type of wound. An attack
produces the type of injury whose Wound
Threshold is equal to or under the amount of
damage inflicted by the attack; only the most
severe of the possible results is applied. For
example, if an attack does 40 points of damage
to an average individual (whose Wound
Thresholds are Flesh Wound = 13, Deep
Wound = 25, Instant Death = 50), the attack
victim suffers a Deep Wound (40 is greater than
the Deep Wound score “25” but is less than
the Instant Death score “50”).
The Wound Threshold of Flesh Wounds is
equal to half of the character’s Stamina (round
up). The Wound Threshold of Deep Wounds
is equal to the character’s Stamina. The Wound
Threshold of instant death is twice the
character’s Stamina. Personal armor, if any is
worn, adds its Armor Points to
each Wound
Threshold individually when the character is
under physical attack; the modified Wound
Threshold should be noted in parentheses after
the original Wound Threshold.
Action penalties are negative modifiers to all
actions that reflect the pain and distraction
induced by wounds. A character is penalized
-1 to all actions per Flesh Wound and -2 to all
actions per Deep Wound. For example, a
character with two Flesh Wounds and one
Deep Wound would have a -4 penalty to all
actions: -2 from the Flesh Wounds and another
-2 from the single Deep Wound.
The final column of the injury list is used to
note how many of each type of injury a
character has sustained and possibly what
they are (see section 3.5).
2.3.3 System Shock Rating
The System Shock rating is a measure of how
many injuries a character can take before
going into shock and dying. If the total of
System Shock and a character’s wound-
induced action penalties equals zero or less,
the character goes into shock (see
Injuries,
section 3.5). System shock is equal to five plus
the character’s Health. System Shock cannot
be lower than one.
System Shock is shown on the character sheet
as a row of boxes — unused boxes are simply
crossed out. As wounds are taken, boxes can
be crossed out according to action penalties,
representing the damage. See
Injuries, section
3.5, for more details on bruises, wounds and
their game effects.

2.4 Perks and Flaws
In order to keep the dice rolling and the
bookkeeping to a minimum, the Silhouette
system uses a fairly small range of numbers
to describe the basic capabilities and skills of
an individual. This can lead to characters that
are fairly similar, especially if they are in the
same general line of work. To help create
unique characters with their own
capabilities, Character Perks and Flaws
(and Special Abilities, for some worlds
— see Chapter Six) are used to provide
additional details.
Each Perk costs a certain amount of Skill
Points (SPs) and each Flaw “gives back”
a certain number of SPs. These are the
same Skill Points that are given to
purchase Skills, so a character with
more Flaws than Perks can gain
additional Skills or Skill Levels, while a
character with more Perks will start with
fewer Skills. Perks and Flaws can be
acquired later on during the game, as
well (see
Experience, section 2.7).
There is no strict limit to the number of
Perks and Flaws a character can have. In
order to prevent excess, we recommend
not exceeding 12 points of Flaws (20 in a
Cinematic game). Gamemasters have final
approval and should make their decision
according to two criteria: whether the Perks
and Flaws fit the character concept and
whether they fit the campaign concept.
The first criterion prevents blind pilots; the
second prevents multimillionaires in a
campaign about pioneers scrounging for
resources (for example).
Gamemasters can also choose to
remove some Perks and Flaws from the
selection altogether. For example, those who
believe in letting Players define their
character’s psychology without concern for
points can eliminate all personality-related
Flaws.
Design Notes:
Previous Versions
If you’re a veteran Silhouette player, you’ll no
doubt notice that some of the Perks and Flaws
have changed. This is mostly for play balance.
We’ve also removed the “Innate/Acquired”
note, because it brought an additional
complexity with little benefits.
Gamemasters should also not impose unfair
costs for Perks. If the campaign concept calls
for everyone to have military rank, be police
officers, or be political leaders, then the Players
need not pay for the relevant Perks.
Gamemasters may have them pay for elevated
rank or especially good reputations, but the
campaign “base line” should be free.
Hooks & Tips: Min-Maxing
Perks and Flaws are intended to give players
a variety of options to define their character.
Unfortunately, the variety of options, each with
a cost or benefit, drives some to make the most
of the system, purchasing a ludicrous number
of Perks and Flaws to get extra Skills and
special abilities. The number of blind, one-
armed combat monsters wanted by the law
and saddled with a large disabled family to
care for is legion in the halls of roleplaying
history.
Solutions to this problem include limiting the
number or gravity of Flaws and Perks. You can
tell Players they can get only one Perk and
one Flaw, forcing them to take only that which
is really important for their character
concept.
In order to make future character creation
easier, only the Perks’ and Flaws’ names and
costs are listed in the table on the next page.
Full descriptions can be found in the reference
section at the end of this game manual.

2.5 Character
Improvement
One of the more blatant rewards of roleplaying
is character improvement. As they learn new
Skills and abilities and grow through the trials
they face in their lives, the characters’
Attributes and other characteristics will
correspondingly rise. They will also learn new
tricks and become more cunning, helping
them to get out of trouble more easily. Simply
put, experienced adventurers are better than
greenhorns. In the Silhouette game system, the
characters’ life experience is recorded in the
form of abstract Experience Points (XPs).
2.5.1 Earning XPs
Experience Points are awarded by the
Gamemaster at the end of each playing
session. His decision is final. Some players
also like to judge each other’s performances
and give additional “audience merit points,”
but this requires a high level of maturity to avoid
self-congratulatory excesses. In general, an
average of five XPs should be awarded for
each session (ten for cinematic campaigns).
Some Gamemasters use the distribution of
Experience Points as the stick and carrot to
control their players, but this is generally a bad
idea that is likely to cause dissension within
the group.

Combat
Nothing seasons a character more than
fighting for one’s life. Combat is a great
source of XPs, though it shouldn’t used to
excess (because of the risk involved and its
lethality). Each player receives 1 XP, just for
being in a combat situation.
Each player receives 1 XP per group of
opponents defeated, if the opponents are
roughly the same in terms of power (i.e.,
have similar Character and Skill Point totals).
Defeating larger or more dangerous
opponents, such as a monster or well-
equipped henchmen, multiply the XP bonus
by their relative power (e.g., defeating an
ogre twice the size of a human brings 2 XPs).
Defeating opponents that are less powerful do
not give any XP at all.
Encounters &
Problem-solving
Simply overcoming challenges can
generate XPs. Difficult situations may be
overcome through death, persuasion,
trickery, or simply figuring out a way to
avoid the confrontation in the first place.
Sometimes, bribing the guard to look the
other way is just as efficient (and less
troublesome) than knocking him out cold.
Each player receives 1 XP per significant
challenge, puzzle or encounter resolved.
Goals
Characters that reach their stated goals
will receive XPs for doing so. How many
depends on the goal itself. This is a good
way to provide the XPs required to buy off Flaws.
Hooks & Tips: Detailed XPs
The system proposed here is somewhat
coarse — there are many occasions where an
XP reward is obviously indicated, but a full XP
is too much. In this case, use a more detailed
XP model, by multiplying all XP awards and
uses by a factor of 1000. This allow the
Gamemaster to hand out smaller amount of
XP as rewards, for example 50, or 300. Some
Silhouette-based settings, such as CORE
Command, use this model by default.
For example, a player that stayed in character
and showed enthusiasm would receive 2000
XPs at the end of the session. When the time
comes to convert them to, say, Emergency
Dice, one ED will be purchased for 1000 XPs.

2.6.2 Spending XPs
A character can stockpile XPs if desired, but
most players will wish to spend theirs, either
to improve their characters or to press their
luck. There are two ways to spend XPs: buying
the life-saving Emergency Dice or improving
either the characters’ Attributes or Skills.
Experienced roleplayers will notice that
character abilities progress rather slowly. The
reason for this is simple: Skills levels of 3 or
more are very powerful. Most of a character’s
core occupational Skills should be level 2.
Secondary occupational Skills and hobby
Skills should be level 1. If a character has level
3 in a “hobby” Skill, it is more than a hobby: it
is an obsession, or a way of life!
Emergency Dice
Everyone gets a certain number of lucky
breaks in life. To represent these lucky breaks,
any or all XPs can be converted to Emergency
Dice, which are then spent to boost crucial die
rolls. Each XP spent buys one Emergency Die.
When spent, these are added to the dice
already available for the roll. Unless the
Gamemaster disagrees, up to five Emergency
Dice may be spent on any single roll.
Emergency Dice can also be spent to save a
character’s life when his vehicle is Overkilled.
Rather than use the normal ejection procedure
outlined in section 5.5.3, the player can opt to
spend five Emergency Dice and escape
automatically with no damage. No roll is
involved — just delete the Emergency Dice
from the character’s total.
Emergency Dice are most often used in
Cinematic Games. For this reason,
Gamemasters of Cinematic Campaigns
usually will give more XPs than usual (see
above). They can also directly give Emergency
Dice to the players, in addition to Experience
Points.
Design Notes: Small Rewards
It is sometimes hard to reward amusing, interesting
or well-roleplayed actions with the coarse XP
system. The easiest way to do so is to use the
“detailed XP” rule and give out small amounts of
XPs (1-50) for small but interesting actions, such as
inviting a lovely girl to dance at the ambassador’s
ball, or grabbing a beer at the local tavern.
The idea is that a character doing activities that
a real person would do and find stimulant should
be rewarded somehow, to make the game more
believable and the characters more “human” (if
applicable). Alternatively, keep a table of small
“favors” for players (like a momentary Skill
bonus, or an additional clue, for example) to
reward this type of roleplaying behavior.
Design Notes:
XPs Distribution
Gamemasters should encourage character
growth without making them into demi-gods.
Make sure the players put some XPs aside as
Emergency Dice, which is probably the most
tangible benefit of good play — they allow PCs
to survive increasingly difficult situations. As a
rule of thumb, about half the XPs received
should be spent on Emergency Dice.

Chapter Two:

ACTION: CORE COMMAND
Attribute Improvement
Improving the character’s Attributes is possible
but very costly in Experience Points to reflect
the time and deep commitment required.
Raising one Attribute by one point costs 50
XPs. An Attribute cannot be increased more
than three times in this manner, although
multiple Attributes can be increased up to
three times each. Beyond the purely rule-
oriented issues, the player should also come
up with detailed background information on
the process — perhaps his character spends
his free nights at the gym or the library?
Skill Improvement
Skills are much easier to improve than
Attributes — all that is required is patience and
regular practice sessions. The base cost to
improve a Skill by one level is the next level
squared, in XPs. Likewise, the base cost to
improve a Skill by one Cpx is the next Cpx
squared, in XPs.
New Skills cost one XP to gain, always
starting at level one (gaining Cpx 1 for
free, as usual). Ideally, there should be
an in-game explanation — Skills don’t
appear out of nowhere.
Skills are improved one level at a time;
levels cannot be skipped in order to save
XPs. All new Skills must be purchased at
level one first; it is recommended that the
players develop a background element
to how their character acquired the Skill.
Hooks & Tips:
Emergency Dice
These represents your character’s true
experience. Experience Points that are put in
raising stats or buying new Skills represent
training and techniques. The real bonus, though,
comes from using Emergency Dice. That’s the
experience that saves the skin of the pilot — he
may not know all those fancy advanced
maneuvers, but he’s got the timing down pat
with what he does know. In the real world, real
experience is essential to reach a certain level
of expertise. Tutors cannot teach that.
As an optional rule, Gamemasters could
require that a number of Emergency Dice be
spent before the Player can buy the next level
for one of his character’s Skills. We recommend
a number of EDs equal to (next Skill level x
next Skill level). For example, to bring a Skill
up to level 4, the Player should have used 16
Emergency Dice with that Skill since he’s
brought it up to level 3.

2.6.3 Tutors
Tutors reduce the XP cost of learning or improving
a Skill. Anyone who has a Skill level greater than
the Skill level of the character wishing to improve
can serve as a tutor; only those possessing
the Teaching Skill or a high level of Skill,
however, will really make a difference.
Hiring: Unless the tutor is another PC, it
is likely that the tutor will have to be hired,
often for a high fee. The suggested cost
for one course is (tutor’s Skill level x Skill
level), multiplied by 1000 credits (or
equivalent, in goods or tasks to perform;
credits being a generic monetary unit
roughly equivalent to a modern dollar).
Finding such a tutor may not always be
easy, especially with high level ones.
Time Required: The period of time
needed to be taught is a number of
months equal to the XP cost of learning
the Skill minus the tutor’s Teaching Skill.
A minimum of one week is required for the
student to gain any benefits from the tutor’s
teaching. The months above are 150-hour
learning periods (about 40 hours per week).
Alternatively, the learning period could be
spread over multiple months or even years. A
minimum of one hour per week must be
maintained to gain any benefit to the character.
In a boot camp-like environment, a number of
these 150-hour “months” equal to (tutor’s
Teaching Skill Cpx +1) can be squeezed into
one real month. This sort of environment is
highly oppressive — a Willpower or Psyche
check against the Skill level being taught is
made every month to prevent nervous
breakdown. Few individuals willingly choose
to undergo training of such intensity.
Teaching XP Rebate: Once the tutelage is
finished, the tutor makes a test. This Skill roll
uses either the Teaching Skill or the Skill being
taught, whichever is highest. This is modified
by the Creativity Attribute of the tutor. The result
is the number of XP points that are subtracted
from the cost of learning or improving the Skill.
If the roll is Fumbled, the cost is doubled due
to the confusion induced by the tutor’s poor
guidance. The cost of learning the Skill cannot
be reduced below a minimal XP cost which is
equal to the new level of the Skill.
Hooks & Tips:
Mentors and Teachers
Tutors make excellent Gamemaster
characters. They run the gamut from the tough
drill sergeant that wakes up the rookies every
morning with a yell loud enough to wake the
dead, to the patient old scientist showing the
intricacies of a complex molecule to his best
students. And of course, one must not forget
what is perhaps the best-known tutor character
of all, the gruffy veteran pilot. He’ll take the
player characters under his wing and teach
them all he knows, then generally get killed in
mid-game so they can become full-fledged
heroes.

2.6.4 Levels (Optional)
Many roleplaying games assign “levels” to
characters, to help show how experienced
(and generally, how powerful) the characters
are. While the Silhouette experience system
doesn’t rely on Experience Levels, it is possible
to assign some to characters. This remains
entirely optional.
Assigning levels are useful in a number of
ways: it showcases the character’s progress;
it allows a comparison of abilities at a glance;
and it helps the Gamemaster assign proper
opposition to the player characters. Some
settings will use levels to give or deny access
and equipment to the character, or use them
as a mark of rank.
To generate a character’s level, tally all the XPs
he has received so far and compare them to
the table. XPs that have been converted to
Attributes, Skills or Emergency Dice all count
— levels are based on the total XP ever earned
by the character. As one can see, XP
requirements for additional levels become
exponential as one rises through the ranks.
This will force characters to seek greater
challenges (which provide more XPs) as they
grow in power and influence.

The XP cost of additional levels is equal to (Level x Level).
Design Notes: Ugh, Levels...
Many gamers consider Levels and other
experience markers to be somewhat primitive
and artificial, harkening back to their early days
as wet-behind-the-ears roleplayers. Still,
artificial or not, Levels do provide several
advantages: they offer a way to measure a
character’s worth (and the kind of challenge
he’s able to face), they allow some game
balance to take place by putting restrictions
on what a character can or cannot use and
(probably their most useful side) they provide
an incentive for continued play. Human beings
are reward-driven: we always want to see
what’s over the next hill, what kind of neat
things we can acquire for our personal treasure
horde. Often, the extra few XPs required to
make it to the next level are the little push that
will get people to play the next session... and
go on brand new adventures.

Core Concepts:
Chapter 2
The followings are examples and further
explanations of the core concepts introduced
in Chapter Two.
Step 1: Concept
Lisa is taking part in a fantasy game. This game
will be run using the Adventurous Reality
Distortion Level. Each character is to be
part of a fairly clearly defined archetype
like Bruiser, Mage, Thief or Woodsman.
Lisa decides she will be playing the
“Woodsman” character and comes up
with a few basic key character points.
The character was a hunter who grew
up in the country. (Lisa thinks it will be
fun to play a bit of a “country bumpkin.”)
He’s fairly fit and is exceptionally perceptive,
with “eagle eyes.” He’s got a strong will, and
is fairly quick to pick up new things. The
character is good with a bow, good at hiding
and sneaking and has a variety of skills that
would prove useful in the woods. Lisa also
thinks that the character should have a code
of honor or be unlucky in love, but she’s not
sure which would be more fun to play.
It takes Lisa a bit to decide on Taran for her
character’s name. Since the group wants to
get playing right away, Lisa wants to start on
the character’s attributes and skills. She’ll fill
out the personal history and description a bit
later.
Step 2: Attributes
See Attributes, section 2.1, for basic rules.
Lisa isn’t very fond of buying Attributes and
would really like to get on to picking her Skills,
so she chose the ‘Quick Start’ Generation
option (see section 2.1.2). This means she gets
one Attribute at +2, four at +1, and the rest at
0.
Based on her character’s description, she
assigns the +2 to Perception. She assigns the
+1’s to Agility, Fitness, Creativity and Willpower.
Build, Knowledge, Psyche, Appearance and
Influence are assigned 0’s (no particular
bonus).
Since Lisa has spent all of her Character
Points, she doesn’t have to worry about
whether she’ll use any extra CPs for
Emergency Dice or for Skill Points. She writes
Taran’s attributes down on the character sheet.
Step 3: Skills
See Skills, section 2.2, for basic rules.
Lisa already has a few ideas about which skills
Taran should have. She picks Notice right
away, due his noted perception. He’s good with
a bow, and is a hunter, so he should have
Archery and Traps. He’s also a woodsman and
she wants him to be good at sneaking and
hiding, so she thinks that Athletics, Craft
(Woodcraft), Stealth, Survival and Navigation
would be good. He should be able to defend
himself, so basic levels in Hand-to-Hand and
Melee would be good. Both Defense and
Combat Sense would be useful in situations
outside of combat. She also thinks that Taran
should know the basics of tending wounds and
such, so she gives him Medicine.
The total costs of the skills is currently 49. Lisa
can still spend one more point, but wants to
move on to Perks and Flaws before finalizing
anything.
Lisa writes down Taran’s skills on a spare sheet
of paper, along with the costs.

quickly speaks to her GM about the
woods near the area the game is
supposed to take place, and finds out
that the Elves often frequent that area.
With her Gamemaster’s approval, she
spends her final Skill Point on Language
(Elven) at level 1/1. Now that she’s spent
all of her skill points, she writes her skills
down on her character sheet.
Step 5: Secondary
Attributes
See Secondary Attributes, section 2.3,
for basic rules.
Now all Lisa has to do is calculate
Taran’s Secondary Attributes.
Strength: Taran’s Bld is 0, and his Fit is +1.
This averages out to +0.5. Since Str is rounded
down, Taran’s Str is 0.
Health: Taran has a Fit of +1, a Psy of 0, and a Wil of
+1. This averages out to +0.667. Hea is rounded
off as normal, so Taran has a Hea of +1.
Stamina: The total of Taran’s Bld and Hea is +1.
This gives Taran a Sta of 30 ((5 x 1) + 25 = 30).
Unarmed Damage: Since Taran’s Bld and Str
are 0, and his Hand-to-Hand level is only 1,
his total UD is 4.
Armed Damage: AD is calculated the same
as UD, but with Melee instead of Hand-to-
Hand. This gives Taran an AD of 4.
Flesh Wound Threshold: This is equal to Sta/
2, so Taran has Flesh Wound Threshold of 15
(30 / 2).
Deep Wound Threshold: Equal to Sta, so it’s
30 for Taran.
Instant Death Threshold: Double Sta, so Taran
has 60.
System Shock: SS is equal to 5+ Hea, so Taran
has a SS of 6.
Lisa writes these down and talks to her GM
about equipment. She is now ready to play.
Step 4: Perks and Flaws
This is an Optional Step — see Perks and
Flaws, section 2.4.
Lisa looks first at the Flaws, because they help
define the character more, and she thinks
they’re more fun to play. She looks at both
Curse and Code of Honor, and decide that
giving Taran a cursed love life would be more
fun. She thinks that giving Taran the Quirk
“Country Bumpkin” would be good.
After looking at the Perks list, the only one that
Lisa thinks would fit with the character concept
is Acute Sense: Sight.
Lisa talks to her GM, and he approves of the
perks and Flaws. He assigns a value of 4 to
Taran’s Curse, because while love does play
a large role in the game, it won’t affect him all
of the time.
Lisa totals up the points for Taran’s Perks and
Flaws and realizes she has 5 extra Skill Points
to spend. She thinks that Taran’s Notice skill
could be bumped up a bit, but doesn’t think
he is a “Veteran” at noticing things. Instead,
she spends 4 points and ups the complexity
rating of his Notice skill, because he’s really
good at noticing details like faint tracks. This
brings his Notice skill up to 2/2 from 2/1. Lisa

Optional Rule: Adding +1 for multiples of the
highest die.
A house rule thatís been around for a while is
to have multiples of the highest die add +1 to
the total. This is similar to the Cinematic rule
featured earlier. This has the effect of slightly
increasing the average roll.

Optional Rule: Adding +1 for multiples of any
die.
Dice that come up the same value (not only
6s) are counted as +1 to the die total for that
number. Thus, a character rolling a 5 5 5 2
would have a total score of (5+1+1)=7. A
character rolling 2 2 2 6 would still have a score
of 6, as it remains the highest possible value
of the die roll (2+1+1 = 4 vs 6). This has the
effect of raising the average die roll, while still
requiring that multiple 6s be rolled for the
highest successes. It also prevents a case
where a player rolls 5 5 5 5, a very very small
statistical chance (and thus ‘lucky’ roll) and
gain nothing from it but a 5.
Optional Rules: Using Eight or Ten Sided Dice
Some people feel limited by the choice of the
classic six-sided die, and prefer to use larger
die types. Silhouette was designed to use six-
sided dice, and as such using larger die types
alters some things and requires the GM to
make a few changes based on these changes
and the feel of the campaign.
Using Larger dice increases the randomness
of tests and decreases the importance of
Attributes and other modifiers. It also makes
combat potentially more lethal, due to the
possibility of a larger Margin of Success. The
larger dice types result in higher rolls, thus
requiring larger thresholds.

Character Skills
• ANIMAL HANDLING
Attributes: INF (training), KNO (basic care)
Specializations: Animal, Herding, Performing Tricks
Possessed By: Farmers, Ranchers, Circus Performers
The Animal Handling Skill measures the ability of a
character to care for and train various animal species.
The Skill includes knowledge of the animal’s preferred
foods and daily habits, reproductive cycle and the basic
signs of disease. Natural Sciences (Life) is needed to
actually treat diseased animals, however.
• ARCHERY
Attributes: AGI (firing), PER (firing at Extreme range)
Specializations: Longbow, Compound Bow, Crossbow, Sling
Possessed By: Athletes, Hunters, Primitives
The Archery Skill allows the character to use primitive
missile weapons such as longbows, slings or crossbows.
This is the primary ranged weapon Skill in historical and
fantasy genres. In settings featuring firearms, this Skill
might still be used for sport and historical events, but rarely
for actual combat. Specialized arrowheads/projectiles can
be used to make the weapons more versatile.
• ATHLETICS
Attributes: AGI (grabbing items), FIT (physical activities),
KNO (evaluating moves)
Specializations: Running, Football, Volleyball, Break Fall,
Climbing, Swimming
Possessed By: Athletes, Sports Enthusiasts, Soldiers
Athletics represents the character’s ability to engage in
sporting and physical activities of all kinds. It includes the
necessary Skills and knowledge of the rules and
regulations along with the physical training required by
athletic activities. Athletics is also used for running, and
climbing up and down a steep (more than 60 degrees)
incline. SeeMovement, section 3.2, for more.
A high Cpx in this Skill represents the ability to perform
tumbling, balancing, or gymnastics. In some game genres,
Acrobatics can be used in combat instead of Defense (see
Chapter 7) — the ability to vault over a group of guards in
an escape or tumble under a hail of bullets from an
opponent’s gun are all highly desirable.
• BUSINESS
Attributes: INF (dealing with people), KNO (techniques)
Specializations: Finance, Management, Foreign Trade,
Accounting, Economics
Possessed By: Businesspeople, Bankers, Accountants
Business is the ability to manage the affairs of a business,
corporation or nation. This could include anything from
compiling product feasibility reports to the creation of
marketing campaigns to promoting a product, whatever
that product may be. A small number of Player Characters
are likely to take this Skill based upon their background.
They may find it useful in a political campaign, but in a
more action-oriented one, its utility may be limited.
• COMBAT SENSE
Attributes: PER (applications), KNO (techniques)
Specializations: Urban, Jungle, Marsh, Night-time,
Ambushes
Possessed By: Soldiers, Police, Criminals, Warzone
Residents
A character with Combat Sense is trained to be aware in
dangerous situations, such as firefights. Combat Sense is
used primarily to detect ambushes and for initiative
purposes. This Skill is useful to the majority of characters
who will take part in a high-adventure campaign, but
characters in a political campaign will probably not need it.
A high Complexity in this Skill represents the character’s
expertise in small-unit tactics (a prime example is the
positioning of troops while they are engaged with enemy
forces). The Skill is useful to commanders of units of all
sizes, and is one of the most important to soldiers who
wish to rise in the ranks. See section 6.3 for advanced
use of this Skill.
• CRAFT (SPECIFIC)
Attributes: varies, but usually CRE or KNO
Specializations: Commercial, Specific sub-category
Possessed By: Artisans, Metalsmiths, Cooks
The Craft Skill covers the ability to produce useful and
artistic creations with one’s hands. A specific craft must
be chosen: it can include such things as cooking,
grooming, jewelry, metalwork, woodcraft, weaving, etc.
The market for fine items makes it lucrative to know one of
these crafts (though only at high levels), and the ability to
recognize the value of such crafts is in demand from many
interested parties.
Grooming, a character’s ability to improve the physical
appearance of a person through the judicious use of
clothing and grooming, is a special craft. The Margin of
Success of a Grooming Skill test vs. 5 (fumbles are
ignored) is added to the character’s Appearance Attribute.
• DEFENSE
Attributes: AGI (diving for cover or dodging), PER (spotting
defensive positions)
Specializations: Unarmed, Melee Attacks, Ranged Attacks
Possessed By: Soldiers, Police, Criminals, Convenience
Store Clerks
The Defense Skill is a measure of how good the character
is at avoiding incoming attacks, whether by making the
best use of available cover (be it a lamp-post, a concrete
wall, or another character) or actually dodging hand-to-
hand or melee blows. Most player characters have this
Skill to some degree.
• DEMOLITION/TRAPS
Attributes: CRE (charge placements), KNO (techniques,
chemistry)
Specializations: Mining, Military, Construction
Possessed By: Military and Industrial Specialists, Terrorists

Demolition is the Skill concerned with setting and
detonating explosive charges in such a way as to maximize
damage done to the target, and either maximize or
minimize the collateral damage caused by the explosion.
The Skill encompasses the ability to deactivate these same
charges. It also includes the knowledge required to
produce various types of explosives from raw materials.
The pre-modern version of this Skill allows one to set traps
and disarm them.
• DISGUISE
Attributes: CRE (putting on), PER (spotting), KNO
(techniques)
Specializations: Specific Disguise, Theatrical Special
Effects, Vehicles, Buildings
Possessed By: Actors, Undercover Agents, FX Specialists,
Rebels
The Disguise Skill covers the physical aspects of changing
the appearance of a person or item, including proper use
of makeup, masks, and clothing. Actual impersonation or
mimicry of a specific person or type of person also require
the Performance Arts (Theatrics) Skill, however.
The Skill also allows the user to disguise constructs, such
as vehicles (Cpx 2), bunkers (Cpx 3) or even bases (Cpx
4), from visual recognition: apply the MoS of the Disguise
effort to the Threshold of any test to recognize the item or
person for what it really is.
• ETIQUETTE (SPECIFIC)
Attributes: INF (interaction), PER (spotting faux-pas)
Specializations: Military, Business, Aristocratic,
Bureaucracy
Possessed By: Sophisticates, Military Officers,
Businessmen
Etiquette reflects the character’s familiarity with proper
methods of social interaction within formalized settings,
such as military ceremonies, upper class gatherings or
business meetings. Many politically-inclined characters
will possess this Skill, regardless of their social standing.
If a character attempts to use his Skill to interact in a related
but unfamiliar milieu, a -2 penalty is imposed on the test.
• FORGERY (SPECIFIC)
Attributes: CRE (creating), PER (spotting), KNO
(techniques)
Specializations: Electronic, Written, Art, Counterfeiting
Possessed By: Criminals, Spies, Police Experts
The Forgery Skill is the character’s ability to accurately
duplicate a variety of objects, such as official documents,
works of art, money, and handwriting. It also encompasses
the ability to recognize a forgery as such, and give an
opinion as to the origin of the forgery based on the style
and materials used in creating it. If a character attempts
to use his Skill to work in a related but unfamiliar field, a -
2 penalty is imposed on the test.
• GAMBLING
Attributes: PER (applications), KNO (techniques), CRE
(cheating), PSY (raw luck)
Specializations: Specific Game, Cheating, Bookkeeping
Possessed By: Gamblers, Bookies, Suburban Husbands
Gambling represents the character’s knowledge of the
rules of games of chance. It further allows the character
to estimate odds, cheat at most games (if required) and
place bets on events. This Skill is one of the old standbys
for many types of characters.
• GUNNERY (SPECIFIC)
Attributes: PER (applications), KNO (techniques)
Specializations: Vehicle Model, Projectile Weapons,
Missiles, Energy Weapons
Possessed By: Combat Pilots, Combat Gunners
Gunnery Skill is required to fire any non-portable weapons,
such as those mounted on vehicles or installations. The
specific areas of knowledge are: Mecha, Ground, Naval,
Air and Space. If a character attempts to use his Skill to
fire weapons on a vehicle type other than one with which
he is familiar, a -2 penalty is imposed on the test.
• HAND-TO-HAND
Attributes: AGI (disarming), FIT (combat and blocking
blows), KNO (evaluating moves)
Specializations: Striking, Grappling, Tripping, Throwing
Possessed By: Boxers, Martial Artists, Police, Soldiers
The Hand-to-hand Skill measures the proficiency of a
character in close-range combat using unarmed fighting
techniques. A high Complexity rating in Hand-to-hand
implies that the character is using some form of martial
art, such as karate or boxing. Almost all military personnel
receive basic training in this Skill, and many other
individuals and professions find it necessary to learn some
of the techniques involved.
• HEAVY WEAPONS
Attributes: PER (using weapons), KNO (maintenance)
Specializations: Machineguns, Mortars, Grenade
Launchers, Missiles
Possessed By: Soldiers, Police, Criminals
The Heavy Weapons Skill is a measure of the character’s
proficiency with man-portable support weapons such as
mortars, grenade launchers and missiles. The Skill
includes basic knowledge of the maintenance procedures.
This Skill is taught almost exclusively in military and para-
military circles and is seldom shown to those not
sanctioned to use it by the authorities. The pre-modern
version of the Skill lets characters build and operate
catapults, trebuchets and similar weapons.

• INFORMATION WARFARE
Attributes: INF (communicating), CRE (use, codebreaking),
KNO (techniques, maintenance)
Specializations: Sensors, ECM, Underwater Sensors,
Comm Jamming
Possessed By: Combat Pilots, Sensor Op Specialists,
Explorers
Information Warfare is a catch-all Skill that covers the
myriad aspects of sensor operations, electronic counter-
measures (ECM), and electronic counter-counter-measures
(ECCM). This Skill is used for detection tests, electronic
jamming, and other similar activities. It is required to
operate and effectively counter communications devices.
It is also used in the design and breaking of codes used
for communications between two parties.
• INTERROGATION
Attributes: APP (flirt), BUI (physical intimidation), INF (wits),
WIL (domination)
Specializations: Casual Questioning, Torture, Specific Type
of Informant
Possessed By: Police Officers, Intelligence Experts
Interrogation measures a character’s ability to extract
information from an unwilling informant. Although such
exchanges can be roleplayed, Gamemasters can use
Opposed Action Tests with informants rolling either WIL
or Interrogation, whichever is higher. A MoS of 4 or more
indicates that the informant may not even realize he has
revealed something of note.
• INVESTIGATION
Attributes: PER (applications), KNO (techniques)
Specializations: Searching, Surveillance, Forensics
Possessed By: Police, Private Detectives, Spies
The Investigation Skill allows the character to collect
information on people, places and events. This information
can be gathered by any means not covered by the
Streetwise or Computer Skills. Player Characters may want
to have this Skill to one degree or another since it allows
them to uncover facts about their antagonists which might
otherwise remain hidden.
• LANGUAGE (SPECIFIC)
Attributes: CRE (applications), KNO (grammar and
vocabulary)
Specializations: Specific Dialect, Specific Jargon
Possessed By: Travelers, Diplomats, Scholars
This is the ability to communicate and be literate. The
number of languages spoken doubles at each Cpx (Cpx
1 is one language, Cpx 2 is two, Cpx 3 is four, and so on).
All characters their native tongue has level two (standard)
or three (if they are highly educated — KNO +1 or higher)
at no cost. Some languages will not be available to all
characters; players should check with their GMs about
which languages their character can learn.
When using social Skills in a foreign language, characters
are limited to their Language level. For example, if the
character has Language at level 1 (and knows Russian)
plus Negotiation at 5, and tries to bribe a Kremlin guard to
let him pass, he can only use Negotiation at level 1.
• LEADERSHIP
Attributes: INF (leading people), PER (evaluating morale
and skills)
Specializations: Military, Political, Business, Cult
Possessed By: Military Officers and NCOs, Politicians,
Businesspeople
Leadership is the capacity to lead others, either by
example or through inspiration. Any group which will see
combat on a tactical scale will dearly need someone to
guide its actions; entering battle without a well-defined
leader only increases the chaos the group will experience.
See section 6.3 for advanced use of this Skill.
• MEDICINE
Attributes: CRE (applications), KNO (techniques), INF
(dealing with patients)
Specializations: Combat, Aquatic, Sports, Neurology,
Forensics, Surgery, Toxicology
Possessed By: Soldiers, Lifeguards, Trainers, Paramedics,
Physicians
Medicine is the ability to diagnose and treat various
pathological conditions, such as dangerous traumas,
diseases and infections. The lowest levels (2/2 and below)
are effectively First Aid: the ability to stabilize wounded
peoples’ conditions so that they can be transported to
more effective treatment.
A higher Medicine Skill is required for any long term
medical treatment such as aiding in recovery from disease,
and for any type of serious internal surgery. A
specializationmust be chosen before a character can go
above Level or Complexity 3.
• MELEE
Attributes: AGI (striking targets), FIT (blocking melee
weapons), KNO (evaluating moves)
Specializations: Knives, Clubs, Fencing
Possessed By: Soldiers, Police, Criminals, Martial Artists
The Melee Skill reflects how good a character is at
attacking and/or defending with close-combat weapons,
such as knives, cudgels or swords. This type of weapon
use is probably the most widespread of all since it involves
relatively little training and mostly inexpensive weapons,
yet increases the amount of damage dramatically.
• NATURAL SCIENCES (SPECIFIC)
Attributes: CRE (applications), KNO (techniques)
Specializations: Various Fields of Study
Possessed By: Professors, Students, Researchers,
Designers

Character Skills
Natural Sciences is a catch-all Skill that includes any of
the “hard” sciences dealing with the universe: earth
(geology, meteorology, etc.), life (biology, virology, etc.)
and physical (mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc.)
sciences.
A specializationmust be chosen before a character can
go above Level or Complexity 3 in this Skill. If a character
attempts to use his Skill in a field other than one with which
he is familiar, a -2 penalty is imposed on the test.
• NAVIGATION (SPECIFIC)
Attributes: CRE (applications), KNO (techniques)
Specializations: Night-time, Map and Compass, Star
Position, Terrain Type
Possessed By: Campers, Explorers, Pilots, Soldiers,
Survivalists
Navigation represents the character’s proficiency in the
various techniques used to track one’s positions and
movements. The specific areas of knowledge are: Sea,
Land, Urban, Air, Space. If a character attempts to use
his Skill to navigate in a terrain other than one with which
he is familiar, a -2 penalty is imposed on the test.
• NEGOTIATION
Attributes: INF (interaction), BUI (intimidation), PER
(evaluating progress), KNO (techniques)
Specializations: Specific Commodity, Specific Culture,
Barter
Possessed By: Traders, Smugglers, Business people,
Ambassadors
Negotiation measures a character’s ability to influence the
final decision in bargaining, or the price in a transactions
(be it for cash, credit or barter). This is always an opposed
Skill roll, with the MoS x 5% as the maximum discount
possible when currency is involved. A Player’s roleplaying
should always be weighed as powerfully as the die roll,
and the specific circumstances of the deal should be kept
in mind. There are many situations in which prices or
positions are firmly fixed, and cannot be affected by
haggling in any way.
• NOTICE
Attributes: PER (applications), KNO (observation
techniques), PSY (human perception)
Specializations: Specific Sense, Night-time, Forward
Observing, Tracking
Possessed By: Researchers, Soldiers, Police, Investigators
Notice is the ability to perceive details that may be
otherwise overlooked. This includes finding a clue hidden
in a crime-scene, spotting a face among the crowd,
reading the fine print on a legal document, etc.
At higher levels, a careful observer may use the Skill to
empathize with the person he is observing and can
sometimes make prudent assumptions about the inner
workings of the target. The pre-modern specialization of
this Skill is Tracking, which can also be used for hunting.
• PERSONAL FLIGHT DEVICE
Attributes: AGI (release timing), FIT (freefall maneuvers),
KNO (packing, evaluating equipment)
Specializations: High-Altitude, High-Wind, Night-Time
Possessed By: Skydivers, Paratroopers, Pilots
The Personal Flight Device Skill allows the character to
use and control a parachute or similar personal flight
device, such as a hang-glider, jet pack or grav belt. It
also includes the ability to prepare and pack parachutes,
make minor repairs to equipment, and estimate wind
speed and evaluate weather patterns that might affect the
drop or flight.
• PERFORMANCE ART (SPECIFIC)
Attributes: CRE (creative process), FIT (art involving body),
INF (acting), KNO (techniques)
Specializations: improvised, performance, genre, tragedy,
comedy
Possessed By: Sophisticates, Professionals, Youth
This is a catch-all Skill for performance art: the number of
arts practiced doubles at each Cpx (Cpx 1 is one, Cpx 2
is two, Cpx 3 is four, and so on). Each art is a separate
field (theatrics/acting, danse, music, mime, singing, etc.).
The Skill covers all aspects of live or recorded
performance. This includes the ability to produce, direct,
act or otherwise work in these media. If a character
attempts to use his Skill to do a performance in a related
but unfamiliar field, a -2 penalty is imposed on the test.
The Treshold of Art tests is chosen by the player — this is
the quality aimed for by the object or representation. A
low Threshold indicates that the artist plans to do
something correct, nothing more, while a high Treshold
means the artist aims to create a masterpiece.
Performance Arts (Theatrics) also allows an actor to
impersonate someone else through the use of disguise,
voice and mannerism mimicry, provided that the
impersonator knows enough about the subject to make
the act convincing.
• PILOT (SPECIFIC)
Attributes: AGI (control), PER (grabbing items, for mecha),
KNO (using onboard systems)
Specializations: Vehicle Model
Possessed By: Combat Crew, Joe Average, etc.
The Pilot Skill is the ability to control the movements of a
vehicle. Although most modern characters are assumed to
have a license and drive competently (unless from a fantasy
background, which use Riding instead), to take a Skill in this
is unusual except for characters who use such vehicles often.
There are five areas of knowledge: Mecha (for humanoid
or limbed vehicles), Ground (for wheeled, tracked and
hover vehicles), Naval (for boats and subs), Air (ballons,
aircraft) and Space. If a character attempts to use his Skill
to control a vehicle type other than one with which he is
familiar, a -2 penalty is imposed on the test.

• RIDING
Attributes: AGI (controlling animals), FIT (riding stunts),
KNO (animal care)
Specializations: Specific Animal, Racing, Dressage
Possessed By: Equestrian Athletes, Ranchers
The Riding Skill measures the character’s ability to control a
riding animal (which have their own Riding modifiers, depending
on their training — see section 6.2). It is used if any difficult type
of maneuver is wanted from the mount. The Skill also includes
a basic ability to care for the animal. Characters from fantasy
background are assumed to be able to ride competently
(modern and future characters use Pilot: Ground instead).
• SEDUCTION
Attributes: APP (first impression), INF (seduction), KNO
(techniques)
Specializations: Specific Sex, Eye Contact, Specific
Seduction Style
Possessed By: Con Artists, Fashion Models, Gigolos,
Prostitutes
Seduction measures a character’s ability to sway others by the
judicious use of looks and sex-appeal. The Skill includes an
understanding of what people find attractive and the ability to
adapt to different preferences. It is possible to get any desired
information from a seductee before any serious things occur,
but beware: sometimes, the roles of the people involved are
reversed, and the seducer may become the seductee.
• SLEIGHT-OF-HAND
Attributes: AGI (grabbing items), PER (spotting/evaluating
moves)
Specializations: Pickpocket, “Magic” Tricks, Shoplifting
Possessed By: Petty Criminals, Stage Magicians, Spies
The Sleight-of-hand Skill is a measure of how good the
character is at the subtle hand movements required by
activities like pickpocketing or stage magic. Abilities such
as palming and concealing small objects upon one’s
person are covered by this Skill.
• SMALL ARMS
Attributes: AGI (combat), KNO (maintenance), PER (sniping)
Specializations: Pistols, Rifles, SMGs
Possessed By: Soldiers, Police, Criminals, Hunters
The Small Arms Skill is a measure of the character’s
proficiency with man-portable firearms such as pistols,
rifles, and submachine guns. The Skill includes basic
knowledge of the maintenance procedures. This is another
popular weapon-related Skill, and many small arms are
available in most modern and future settings (though at
various levels of legality).
• SOCIAL SCIENCES (SPECIFIC)
Attributes: CRE (applications), KNO (techniques), INF
(dealing with people)
Specializations: Various Fields of Study
Possessed By: Professors, Students, Researchers
Social Sciences is a catch-all Skill that includes any of the
“humanities” sciences dealing with people and societies:
anthropology, history, law, linguistics, literature, sociology,
political science, philosophy, or psychology (the latter
being high-Level/Cpx in Social Sciences).
A specializationmust be chosen before a character can
go above Level or Complexity 3 in this Skill. If a character
attempts to use his Skill in a field other than one with which
he is familiar, a -2 penalty is imposed on the test.
• STEALTH
Attributes: AGI (move silently), CRE (hide), PER (spotting),
KNO (evaluating moves)
Specializations: Urban, Indoors, Jungle, Woodlands,
Nighttime, Desert, Winter
Possessed By: Thieves, Spies, Soldiers, Police,
Commandos, Hunters, Snipers
The Stealth Skill is the ability to go undetected, be it by
human observers or by electronic surveillance devices. It
also represents a character’s proficiency at using make-
up, special clothing, and netting to conceal himself or other
objects by matching the texture and color scheme of the
surrounding terrain. The Skill allows the user to set
ambushes or to dissimulate himself from his ennemies.
He can also hide constructs, such as vehicles (Cpx 2),
bunkers (Cpx 3) or even bases (Cpx 4), from visual
detection: apply the MoS of the camouflage effort to the
Threshold of any test to spot the concealed item or person.
• STREETWISE
Attributes: INF (interaction with people), PER (spotting
opportunities), KNO (contacts)
Specializations: Gangs, Organized Crime, Homeless,
Prostitutes, Getting Item (Specify)
Possessed By: Urban Residents, Gang Members,
Criminals
Streetwise is a catch-all Skill for interacting with the
“shadier” elements of society and includes basic
knowledge of the underground of a city the character is
familiar with. Obtaining illicit drugs, purchasing illegal
firearms or just finding out what is going on through non-
standard channels, are all activities which Streetwise
encompasses.
• SURVIVAL (SPECIFIC)
Attributes: CRE (creating), PER (spotting), KNO
(techniques)
Specializations: Jungle, Desert, Winter, Urban, Foraging,
Shelter
Possessed By: Soldiers, Campers, Survivalists
The Survival Skill allows the character to survive in hostile
environments, such as jungles or deserts. Survival includes
hunting, foraging, and obtaining shelter and water (space
survival, being very different, is covered in the Zero-G Skill).
The number of environments known doubles at each Cpx
(Cpx 1 is one, Cpx 2 is two, Cpx 3 is four, and so on). If a
character attempts to use his Skill to survive in an unfamiliar
terrain, a -2 penalty is imposed on the test.

• TEACHING
Attributes: CRE (teaching), KNO (techniques)
Specializations: Any other skill
Possessed By: Professors, Combat Instructors
Teaching is the Skill of transmitting knowledge and
expertise to others in a clear and coherent fashion. It is a
Skill which few Player Characters who are not from an
instructional background possess, since most PCs spend
their lives learning Skills necessary for their chosen
profession and are generally ready to retire by the time
they are interested in passing their knowledge along. See
Experience, section 2.5, for advanced use of this Skill.
• TECHNICAL SCIENCES (SPECIFIC)
Attributes: CRE (applications), KNO (techniques)
Specializations: Various Fields of Study
Possessed By: Professors, Students, Researchers,
Designers
Technical Sciences is a catch-all Skill that includes any of
the sciences dealing with the technical abilities required
to operate, repair, maintain and create any equipment of
the specified type not covered elsewhere in the Skill
descriptions. This includes computer (system use,
maintenance, programming, system admin, neural nets),
electronics (electronic devices, security systems, lasers)
and mechanics (all mechanical and structural devices —
automotive, industrial, locks, hydraulics).
A specializationmust be chosen before a character can
go above Level or Complexity 3 in this Skill. If a character
attempts to use his Skill in a field other than one with which
he is familiar, a -2 penalty is imposed on the test.
• TINKER
Attributes: CRE (creating), PER (spotting opportunities),
KNO (techniques)
Specializations: Vehicles, Weapons, Appliances,
Computers
Possessed By: Inventors, Technicians, Hobbyists
The Tinker Skill allows a character to build or modify
machinery under time constraints (jury-rig a temporary
repair), poor conditions (lack of proper tools) or to modify
equipment in novel and desperate ways (install a car
engine to power a boat). Items built or modified using this
Skill, rather than the proper Technical Skill(s), will only last
as long as needed, and then fall apart; if used by anyone
else, they also fall apart. A new Tinker test against the
creation Threshold must be made whenever the item is
pushed or takes damage; if failed, the item suffers a
malfunction that requires one full-round action to fix. If
Fumbled, the item falls apart.
• THROWING
Attributes: AGI (striking targets), KNO (evaluating
distances)
Specializations: Knives, Javelins, Balls, Grenades, Darts
Possessed By: Soldiers, Game Players, Athletes
The Throwing Skill is the ability to accurately throw an
object at a target. It is the Skill used when throwing
grenades and other offensive weapons. The sports and
activities which use this Skill are too numerous and varied
to mention.
• TRIVIA/LORE (SPECIFIC)
Attributes: varies, but usually KNO
Specializations: Specific sub-category of the Trivia/Lore
category
Possessed By: Gamers, Fans, Socialites
The Trivia (Lore, for pre-modern settings) Skill covers the
ability to recall knowledge on a very specific topic. A field
of knowledge must be chosen: it can include such things
as games, medieval history, cars, etc. A successful Skill
test produces a bit of obscure yet useful information
relevant to the situation at hand.
• VISUAL ART (SPECIFIC)
Attributes: CRE (creative process), KNO (techniques)
Specializations: improvised, medium
Possessed By: Sophisticates, Professionals, Youth
This is a catch-all Skill for visual art: the number of arts
practiced doubles at each Cpx (Cpx 1 is one, Cpx 2 is
two, Cpx 3 is four, and so on). Each art is a separate field
under the same Skill (calligraphy, painting, drawing,
sculpting, pottery, etc.). If a character attempts to use his
Skill to do a performance in a related but unfamiliar field,
a -2 penalty is imposed on the test.
The Treshold of Art tests is chosen by the player — this is
the quality aimed for by the object or representation. A
low Threshold indicates that the artist plans to do
something correct, nothing more, while a high Treshold
means the artist aims to create a masterpiece.
• ZERO-G
Attributes: FIT (moving about), KNO (evaluating moves,
suit procedures)
Specializations: Rapid Movements, Delicate Movements,
Melee, Ranged Combat
Possessed By: Anyone living in space
Zero-G reflects the ability of the character to move about
and perform actions in weightless or micro-gravity (under
0.1 g) environments. The Skill includes basic knowledge
of vacuum suit procedures; in an emergency, a person
with this Skill can instruct another individual in the
rudimentary use of the suit. It also includes space survival
techniques, such as how to work an airlock, patch a hole
or use an emergency evacuation pod.
For combat in weightless or micro-gravity (under 0.1 g)
environments, the lowest Skill level of either Zero-G or the
usual combat Skill (Hand-to-Hand, Melee, Throwing,
Archery or Small Arms) is used. The changes in balance,
momentum and a host of other details will turn a deadly
warrior into a slowly drifting corpse without proper training.

Character Perks
• ACCELERATED HEALING
Thanks to some natural vigor, the character heals faster
than other people. The normal healing rules are used (see
section 3.5), but the character needs only three-quarters
of the required time. Accelerated Healing has no
downside.
• ACUTE SENSES (SPECIFIC)
Hearing: The character has excellent hearing and tends
to notice faint or high-pitched sounds more readily than
other people. He gets a +1 modifier for Notice checks
based on hearing. The downside is that sudden loud
noises (like a nearby explosion) can momentarily deafen
a character.
Sight: The character has sharp eyes and tends to notice
faraway or small items more readily than other people. He
gets a +1 modifier for Notice checks based on vision. The
downside is that sudden bright lights (stepping out of a
dim area into sunlight) can momentarily blind a character.
Smell/Taste: The character has a sharp nose or palate
and can readily identify odors and tastes. He gets a +1
modifier for Notice checks based on smell or taste.
• AMBIDEXTROUS
The character can use either hand for tasks requiring
manual dexterity without the “Using Off Hand” penalty,
though he may not attack twice per action. Ambidextrous
has no downside.
• ANIMAL COMPANION
The character has a faithful pet, steed or companion. This
animal is both well trained and emotionally bonded to the
character, meaning it will stay by his side other than
(perhaps) the occasional romp through the neighborhood.
The downside of an Animal Companion is responsibility:
pets must be fed, walked and housed. Cost depends on
the animal’s size (1 for a small pet like a ferret, 2 for a
medium one like a dog, 4 for a large one like a gorilla) and
intelligence (1 if untrainable, 2 if capable of obeying basic
commands, 4 if trained and intelligent).
• ANIMAL KINSHIP
The character has a “touch’” with animals. Domesticated
animals will respond well to training and instructions,
granting the character a +1 to all Animal Handling or Riding
Skill tests. Wild animals are less likely to attack the
character and may respond to some basic commands
once the character makes a basic connection with the
beast (specific details are left to the Gamemaster).
• AUTHORITY
The character represents the authorities. He could be a
policeman, a secret agent, a Military Police agent, etc.
The effect of this Perk depends largely on the
circumstances — policemen have no extra authority
outside their jurisdiction. The potential downside of
Authority is responsability: the character will likely be
subject to a code of conduct, have to report for duty or
follow orders.
• COMMON SENSE
The character always considers the outcomes of his
actions first. The Gamemaster gives the player a warning
when the character is about to do something foolish, even
if there is no indication of danger. The GM does not have
to give any details. Common sense has no downside.
• CONNECTIONS
The character has one or more useful connections. These
can be close allies who would be willing to help the
character no matter what, or more casual acquaintances
who are especially useful. This Perk does not cover casual,
personal relationships (such as a lover, friends and
neighbors) unless they are particularly useful or dedicated.
Allies are connections who are willing and able to help
the character, even in dire circumstances, without asking
for much in return (at least not immediately). Examples
include a brother who is also a police sergeant.
Contacts are connections who will not necessarily go out of
their way to help the character without promise of
recompense. They generally provide useful information or
equipment, but will not come to the rescue at their own risk.
Typical contacts include a snitch, a smuggler or a forger.
The potential downside of Connections is reciprocity.
Contacts will expect either to be paid in cash or by being
owed favors. Allies are less demanding, but are likely to
call for help when they need it. Turning down an allies call
for help is a sure way tolose that ally.
• DOUBLE JOINTED
The character’s entire body can contort and flex in
seemingly impossible ways. The character can fit into
spaces half the size of what regular people can, as well
as being able to easily slip out of restraints unless special
precautions are taken (+1 to escape tests).
• FAKE IDENTITY
The character has more than one identity. He has a
complete, fully-detailed life on the side, with separate
dwelling, job and identification papers. People attempting
to track the cover identity back to the character will find it
very difficult to do. The potential downside of Fake Identity
is maintenance. The character needs to spend time and
money keeping his alter ego current, doing such things
as making bank transactions, subscribing to newspapers
or even making appearances as that person.
• FAMOUS
The character is famous. He can be a well-known artist or
a political figure. In certain situations, famous will work for
the character — people will readily help him or provide
access to restricted areas. Fame’s potential downside is

Character Perks
• LONGEVITY
The character’s lifespan is longer than that of a normal
person’s — past mid-life, he will always look and feel like
someone half his age. Longevity’s only downside is the
envy of others and outliving friends and loved-ones.
• LUCKY
The character is exceptionally lucky. Once per session,
the Player may elect to reroll a Fumble. Alternatively, he
can choose to switch the modifier of a single die roll once
per session,after the test has been made — for example,
turning a -3 into a +3.
• MACHINE-TOUCH
The character is exceptionally good with machines and
has an uncanny understanding of their workings. Any task
to repair machinery and devices is considered to be
Complexity 1, regardless of the device.
• PERFECT PITCH
The character always knows if something is in tune and
gains a +1 bonus to any musical or sound-related task.
• PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY
The character has an excellent memory. Whenever a
Knowledge roll is made to recall information previously
seen, heard or read, the rating of the Perk is added to the
dice roll. The downside is that traumatic events can also
be recalled: a character with the Flashback Flaw will have
a Threshold of 5 instead of 4.
• PROPERTY
The character owns a substantial and useful piece of
property. This could include a one-of-a-kind weapon, a
nightclub, a ship, or a mansion used as a headquarters.
This Perk should only be used for key story props and
settings — the owner of a lavish cruise boat should have
this Perk, but an accountant with a condo and car does
not need it. The downside of property is upkeep: ships,
dwellings and clubs must be maintained and staffed, and
items can be stolen or confiscated.
1 or 2 point objects are small items: a leading-edge high-
powered computer for a hacker, or a tricked-out rifle for a
hitman. Higher costs are for bigger items: 3 (small vehicle)
to 6 (nightclub, etc.) to 9 (large estate).
• QUICK LEARNER
The character learns quite rapidly and can gain extra
benefit from tutors who try and impart their knowledge
upon them. Quick Learners subtract one from the number
of months of tutelage required to learn a Skill from a tutor,
although the minimum remains one week. Those teaching
a Quick Learner also get a +1 bonus to their Teaching
Skill test to reduce the XP cost of a Skill increase. Quick
Learner has no downside.
lack of anonymity. The character may be recognized
wherever he goes (Notice vs. 8 - cost of Perk), and may
be watched by the press and other interested parties. This
can make subtlety or stealth very difficult.
• FAVOR
Someone important or a powerful group owes the
character one or more favors. This debt is real and known
by both the character and the indebted party and is likely
to be honored, all things being equal. The character may
call in this debt when convenient, although story elements
may limit his opportunity to do so. The downside of a Favor
is resentment: if the character is not careful, the indebted
party may feel he is being taken advantage of.
Financial Debts Debts of Honor Point Cost
20,000 credits key favor 1
50,000 credits multiple favors 2
75,000 credits major boon 3
150,000 credits multiple boons 4
500,000 credits life boon 5
• IMMUNITY
The character is immune to one, and only one, specific
drug, poison or disease that shows up in the setting. This
Perk can be acquired: it is possible to build an immunity
to toxins or diseases. Immunity only has a downside if it is
a beneficial drug the character is immune to.
• INFLUENCE
The character is either a recognized authority or carries
significant prestige in a certain social, geopolitical or
professional sphere. Although this is not a guarantee that
the character will get his way all the time, his opinion will
be listened to (+1 to INF tests for each 2 points of Perk),
and he can find others to support him if need be. Typical
areas of influence include: a city, the military, big business,
the media and a government. Influence’s downside is
notoriety: others in the same field may seek the character
out or target him.
• INTUITION
The character gets uncanny hunches and bursts of
inspiration, and the Gamemaster can allow the player to
make CRE rolls whenever he thinks the character might
get one, even if there are no obvious clues present.
Fumbled CRE rolls for Intuition result in extremely poor
guesses, and are Intuition’s only downside.
• LIGHT SLEEPER
The character sleeps lightly and awakens at the slightest
noise. He cannot be surprised when sleeping and always
gets a normal defense roll. Light Sleeper has no downside,
other than that it may be difficult to get a good night’s
sleep in a noisy environment.

• RADIATION RESISTANCE
The character is exceptionally resistant to radiation
poisoning. When making Health tests for status, he gets a
+1 modifier to his dice roll.
• RANK
The character is a recognized member of a powerful
military, paramilitary or civilian organization. This station
will give him authority in certain circles as well as access
to resources, contacts and equipment.
Military Rank indicates membership in an organized
military force with authority from a nation. Paramilitary Rank
indicates membership in a force that wields armed might
and is organized along military lines, but does not serve
as the main defense force of a nation (such as police or
militia). Para-military forces may or may not operate with
government authority. Civilian Rank indicates membership
in an organized and powerful non-military organization,
such as a powerful zaibatsu, a government department
or an organized crime family. Civilian Rank is categorized
according to generic stations and should be purchased
only if membership confers a real benefit. Note that military
rank has a fixed cost, but civilian and paramilitary rank is
provided with a cost range depending on the power and
influence of the group.
The potential downside of Rank is responsibility. Members
of the military or other powerful groups have to follow
codes of conduct, abide by regulations and follow orders
from superiors.
Rank Military PM/Civilian

• SENSE OF DIRECTION
The character seems to have a compass in his head. He
always knows where he is located and never seems to
get lost. In space, characters with the 3D Sense of
Direction can always figure their orientation in relation to
a spacecraft, station or nearest celestial body. Sense of
Direction has no downside.
• SENSE OF TIME
The character always knows what time it is and always
know how much time has passed from any one event to
another.
• STRONG IMMUNE SYSTEM
Characters with a Strong Immune System are especially
resistant to diseases and the effects of drugs. These
characters get a +1 to Health tests made against the
contagion and virulence of diseases, as well as the
Potency of a drug or toxin (seeDisease, section 6.3). A
Strong Immune System has no inherent downside other
than the fact that the character will also resist beneficial
drugs, such as analgesics.
• SUBORDINATES
The character has one or more faithful servants. These
subordinates are professionally bound to serve the
character in a well-defined way, but do so above and
beyond the call of duty. The player and Gamemaster
should develop the conditions of servitude as well as the
identities of all subordinates; they need not be fully statted
out, but core competences should be determined. Typical
subordinates include: menservants, bodyguards, and
executive assistants. The downside of Subordinates is
responsibility: they must often be paid and they may
legitimately ask for assistance from time to time.
• THICK-SKINNED
The character has a high pain Threshold, allowing him to
resist injuries that would put lesser people out of
commission. Thick-skinned characters add five points to
their Stamina and recalculate their damage Thresholds
accordingly. Thick-Skinned has no downside.
• WEALTHY
The character has money. Lots of it. Exactly how much
depends on the characteristic’s rating. The rating is
multiplied by 10,000 to know how many credits the
character can get within the hour, provided he is within
communication range of a financial institution (any light
speed delays, if proper for the campaign, are added to
the hour). Each use of Wealth temporarily reduces the
rating by one for a full week, and further uses will continue
to reduce the rating and “reset the clock” for recuperating
wealth.
For example, a character with level 3 Wealth draws 30,000
credits on Monday, so his Wealth is reduced to 2. The
next Thursday he withdraws another 20,000 credits (his
new maximum). This means his Wealth is considered 1
until the following Thursday, when it climbs to 2. It will return
to level 3 the Thursday after that. Optionally, characters
can have non-renewable Wealth that indicates a fixed
amount of cash that isn’t making money for itself. The
Wealth reduction from spending in this case is permanent.
The potential downside of Wealth is responsibility. The
wealthy must maintain their fortunes, taking at least some
interest in their holdings. Tax audits and lawsuits may also
be targeted at wealthy characters.

• ADDICTION
The character is psychologically or physically addicted
to something. It might be drugs, it might be adrenaline, it
might even be sex, but he needs regular doses of it. The
character is considered eitherdependent oraddicted to
a drug. Characters “addicted” to an activity (sex, danger,
etc.) are considered dependent on that activity, with a
Dependence Rating of 5. For more details seeAddiction,
section 6.3. Note that a character can be both addicted
and dependent on the same drug.
This Flaw also covers any kind of physical or mental
deficiency (such as ulcers, heart condition, severe
depression or paranoid schizophrenia) that must be
controlled through regular use of medication. Failure to
take regular doses can lead to symptoms similar (in terms
of game modifiers) to an addict going through withdrawal.
The player and Gamemaster can decide whether this
version of the Flaw is permanent or if it can be cured.
• AGE
The character is either unusually young or old, which may
impose limits on his freedom of movement and on how
seriously others take his opinions. Young characters are
considered to be teenagers (13-16 years for humans) or
younger, and will have a great deal of trouble being taken
seriously by adults, may have to attend school and may
not be able to get into adult establishments like bars. Old
characters are considered senior citizens (65+ for
humans), may also have problems with respect and may
have health problems. The potential upside of Age is
attitudes: juvenile misbehavior may be forgiven, and older
characters may benefit from some respect from the young.
Young characters may have a maximum BLD and KNO of
0 and may not have any Skills beyond Level or Cpx 3. Old
characters may have a maximum AGI and FIT of 0.
• AMNESIAC
The character has no recollection of his life up to a few
days or weeks ago. This Flaw should be severely
monitored by the Gamemaster, because it can easily play
havoc with a campaign. The potential upside of Amnesia
is unknown allies or even Skills (which can be paid out of
the XPs given for the session). Some friends from the
character’s past life may be willing to help them, although
some enemies may well be close behind.
• ANIMAL ANTIPATHY
Something about the character is disturbing to animals,
both domestic and wild. Domesticated animals are less
likely to respond to commands or stay calm in his presence
and he suffers a -1 penalty to Animal handling and Riding
tests. Wild animals are more likely to attack the character
and, even if they don’t attack, will respond aggressively
to his presence. Animal Antipathy has no upside;
characters with this Flaw may have one Animal Companion
(for some reason, the Antipathy does not work against that
one particular animal).
• BAD LUCK
The character is constantly plagued by bad luck. Once
per game, an opponent may reroll a Fumble. Alternatively,
the Gamemaster can choose to switch the result of a die
roll once — for example, turning a +3 into a -3. The
Gamemaster, however, may not use this to hurt or kill the
character outright, only to make his life miserable.
• BELIEFS
The character strongly believes something that is generally
not accepted and can expose him to ridicule in the
mainstream: the Earth is hollow and contain alien artifacts,
there are ghost ships sailing in uncharted oceans, etc.
This belief could even be dangerous, leading the character
to take huge risks, such has heading out for a “hollow
asteroid ship” with no supplies. The only upside is that
the character may attract allies who share his convictions,
although having delusional conspiracy theorists as allies
is at best a mixed blessing.
• BLOODLUST
The character is either inherently mean and vicious or
suffers from a lack of control due to desensitization or
dehumanizing training. When in combat, he will attempt
to kill his opponent by any means possible. He’ll never
accept surrender, nor will he surrender or retreat himself.
When prisoners must be taken, they live only as long as
they are useful. Characters suffering from Bloodlust who
wish to overcome their deadly instincts must pass a WIL
test against a Threshold of 5.
• CODE OF HONOR
The character lives by a code of honor. The player and
Gamemaster should define this code in terms of how
stringent it is and how seriously the character takes it.
Note that “honor” can mean many things to many people,
so it may take some time to decide exactly what this code
entails. A Code of Honor’s potential upside is respect:
characters who behave in a consistently honorable manner
— especially when it puts them at a disadvantage — may
gain the trust and admiration of other honorable people.
• CRIMINAL BACKGROUND
At some point in his past, the character committed a
criminal act. He may have done some prison time or gotten
away free, but the incident continues to haunt him in some
way. This could entail a criminal record making it hard to
get a job or respect or “old friends” continuously appearing
in awkward situations. Criminal Background’s potential
upside is contacts: at times these “old friends” can be
somewhat useful.

• CURSE
The character is under a curse, whether real or imagined.
Regardless, it should affect the character in tangible ways.
This characteristic is more akin to a tragic destiny than to
a supernatural “hex.” The player should choose one
particular aspect of the character’s life (love life, job,
friendships, finances, etc.) that continuously refuses to
“work out.” Curse cannot be tied to any Skill tests.
• DEBT
The character owes someone a substantial debt, which
can include money but also debts of honor or patronage.
The person to whom the character is indebted may be
tolerant or demanding, but the debt is a recurrent drain
on the character’s time or resources. The potential upside
of a debt is a contact: the person who the character owes
may be able to be of some help occasionally, although it
usually means ending up further in debt.
Financial Debts Debts of Honor Point Cost
20,000 credits key favor -1
50,000 credits multiple favors -2
75,000 credits major boon -3
150,000 credits multiple boons -4
500,000 credits life boon -5
• DEDICATED
The character is dedicated to a certain cause. He will
follow its ideals whenever possible. The more extreme form
of this characteristic is fanaticism. Dedication’s potential
upsides are contacts and respect. Others dedicated to
the same cause (or who respect the cause) may be willing
to help a truly dedicated character, although they may
also expect such help themselves.
• DEPENDENT
The character must take care of someone: an adopted
child, a relative, etc. This responsibility includes care,
protection and friendship and should be quite demanding
on the character’s schedule. A Dependent’s potential
upside is aid: the other character may be helpful in certain
situations.

• DESTITUTE: The character doesn’t have much money
and has no secure source of income. Characters who
obtain such a source during play will find forgotten debts
catching up with them until they pay off this Flaw in XPs.
Poor characters cannot afford anything except the basics
without passing Streetwise tests or making arrangements
through roleplaying.
• FLASHBACKS
The character has sudden flashbacks of his past,
especially in stressful situations. The Player and
Gamemaster should define just what these flashbacks are
and what trauma they stem from. Specific triggers fro the
flashbacks can also be chosen. Characters experiencing
flashbacks must make a WIL or PSY test against a
Threshold of 4 to act. Flashbacks have no upside.
• GOAL
The character has a powerful, all consuming goal to which
he is dedicated to the point of obsession. The player and
Gamemaster should define this goal, making sure that it
is largely unattainable, giving the character a strong
motivation. This is mostly a roleplaying Flaw, but
Gamemasters may request WIL tests if a character wishes
to do something that would hinder reaching the goal (such
as letting a bad guy go free to help a friend).
• HEAVY SLEEPER
The character sleeps like a brick and is very hard to
awaken, and has a tendancy to oversleep. Heavy Sleepers
must make PER or Notice tests with a -3 penalty to see if
they awake in a dangerous situation.
• INFAMOUS
The character has a bad reputation. It may or may not be
deserved, but it sticks to the character like the proverbial
bad penny. Infamous can denote unpleasant reputations
(e.g. a notorious cheat) or something more terrifying (e.g.
an underworld assassin). Infamy’s potential upside is fear:
those with terrible reputations may be intimidating.
• INSOMNIAC
The character cannot go to sleep or is plagued by constant
nightmares. He is constantly tired (if using the Fatigue
rules, add an additional -1 per missed night of sleep).
Optionally, the Gamemaster may impose a -1 penalty for
actions that require endurance and prolonged
concentration.
• LAME
The character has a medical problem in one or both legs.
This condition may be temporary, the result of an accident
for example, or it may be permanent, if the character cannot
have his legs fixed for any number of reasons. The character
suffers a -1 modifier to movement-related Skill checks, and
cannot perform activities that require jogging or faster
movement.
• LIAR
The character generally does not tell the truth. Whenever
he speaks, he will lie if it is practical or gets him off the
hook. A more serious version of this is the full-blown
mythomaniac, who cannot tell the truth and keeps
inventing stories about himself and the people around him.

• MECHANICAL INEPTITUDE
The character is “all thumbs” when it comes to mechanical
or electronic devices. Any task to use or repair machinery
and devices is considered to be Complexity 3, regardless
of the device.
• MOTION SICKNESS
The character gets sick and nauseous when exposed to
feelings of movement, such as when riding in a car or
floating in free fall. Whenever the character finds himself
in such an environment, he gets a penalty equal to the
rating of this Flaw to all tests.
• NEMESIS
The character has a long-time enemy or rival. Whenever
they meet, they engage in contest of wit or plain combat.
If the character gets rid of his Nemesis, another one will
pop up to replace him until the point cost is paid back (a
vengeful lover? younger sibling?). The player and
Gamemaster should cooperate to create the Nemesis and
determine how the rivalry began. Nemesis’ potential upside
is allies: then enemy of your enemy may be your friend.
• OBLIGATION
The character is under some kind of obligation. He may
have a steady job and be required to show up on schedule,
or he can have to obey certain persons. The Player and
the Gamemaster should cooperate to define the scope of
the obligations and the reasons why the character is under
orders. Note that characters who have the Authority or
Rank Perks cannot purchase Obligation tied to the same
employment that confers these benefits — the obligations
are just part of the territory. They can, however, have other
Obligations. Obligations have a potential upside in
contacts: superiors and fellow employees can occasionally
be of help.
• ONE-ARMED
The character is missing an arm. This condition may be
temporary, the result of an accident for example, or it may
be permanent, if the character cannot have it replaced
for any number of reasons. The character suffers a -1
modifier to any manipulation-related Skill checks, and
cannot perform activities that require both hands.
• PARANOID
The character believes that some people are in league to
cause him harm. Anything bad that comes to him is
automatically the result of this conspiracy. Anyone refusing
to believe in said conspiracy is automatically part of it and
probably out to get the character — or so he thinks.
• PHOBIA
The character has an unreasonable fear of something. It
might be a certain item, a situation, a color, or an animal.
Mild Phobias mean that the character suffers a -1 action
penalty when in the presence of the object of his phobia,
due to nervousness and distraction.Severe Phobias mean
that the character must pass a WIL test against a Threshold
of 4 to function at all in the presence of the object; even
then, he suffers a -1 action penalty. Gamemasters can
adjust the cost of the Perk to -1/-3 for uncommon objects
of Phobia (water in a desert-based campaign, for example).
• POOR SENSES (SPECIFIC)
Hearing: The character has especially poor hearing
(although he is not deaf). He has trouble distinguishing
sounds that are faint or muffled. The character suffers a -
1 penalty to all Notice tests related to hearing.
Sight: The character has especially poor eyesight
(although he is not blind). He has trouble noticing details
until they are literally right in front of him. The character
suffers a -1 penalty to all Notice tests related to vision.
Sense of Smell/Taste: The character has trouble noticing
odors or tastes unless they are very strong. The character
suffers a -1 penalty to all Notice tests related to smell or
taste. This has no upside, though the character can eat
really bad food.
Blind/Deaf: It is possible the character cannot hear or see
at all. This condition may be temporary, the result of an
accident for example, or it may be permanent, if the
character cannot have his eyes or ears replaced for any
number of reasons. The character suffers a -2 modifier to
his general Notice checks, and cannot perform activities
that require hearing (if Deaf) or sight (if Blind).
• QUIRK
A quirk is a small personality Flaw or habit that poses only
minor limitations on actions. Quirks are intended as
roleplaying aids to reward players for giving their
characters some life. This should not be abused, however,
so players receive extra Skill Points only for their first two
Quirks. Common Quirks are listed below, but
Gamemasters and players should feel free to add others
as long as they are not severely limiting. Note that Quirks
can include good habits (such as always giving to charity
or taking in strangers) as long as they are mildly
inconvenient for the character. At the Gamemaster’s
discretion, characters who wish to suppress their Quirk
temporarily (e.g. cowards who must run into danger) must
pass a WIL test against a Threshold of 5.
Common Quirks include: afraid of heights, can’t swim,
cowardice, cruelty, curiosity, gluttony, greed, intolerance,
lacking a sense of humor, laziness, miserly compulsion,
overconfidence, pacifism, pride, selfishness,
squeamishness, stubbornness, vengeance fixations, and
miscellaneous good or bad habits.
• RADIATION VULNERABILITY
The character is exceptionally vulnerable to radiation
poisoning. When making Health checks for status, he gets
a -1 modifier to his dice roll.

• SECRET
The character has a dark secret in his past. The Player
and Gamemaster should decide on the nature of the
secret, but there should always be a good reason why
this element must be kept hidden. It could be a criminal
past (Criminal Background represents aknown criminal
past), a past indiscretion, a current illicit affair, or any
number of other damaging information. If the secret is
revealed and the player does not pay the XP to remove it,
then another level to the secret, or a different secret
altogether must be chosen.
• SICKLY
The character has a serious ailment that impairs him in
some way. The player and Gamemaster should define the
illness and its symptoms. An important (if medically
inaccurate) distinction is between degenerative and
chronic diseases. Degenerative diseases (such as cancer)
will only get worse if untreated, while chronic disease are
stable but debilitating.
• SLOW HEALING
The character heals more slowly than other people. The
normal healing rules are used (see section 3.5.6), but the
character needs 50% more time to heal.
• SLOW LEARNER
The character has a hard time learning in a structured or
academic environment. He still benefits from teachers, but
less than most. A Slow Learner must add one to the
number of months required to learn a Skill with a tutor (the
time can still be reduced to one week by skilled teachers,
however). Those teaching Slow Learners also suffer a -1
penalty to their Teaching Skill test to reduce XP cost.
• SOCIAL STIGMA
The character is part of a social group that has a bad
reputation. People will shun him and, in the more extreme
case, try to harm him. The Gamemaster and player should
cooperate to define the stigmatized group and the nature
of the stigma.
To eliminate this Flaw, the character must spent
appropriate XPs, but also either prove he is no longer a
part of the group or somehow end the stigma toward the
group. Stigma’s potential upside is contacts: other
members of the stigmatized group may be willing to
cooperate for mutual benefit.
• SPLIT PERSONALITY
The character has two or more personalities. They are
usually different aspects of the same person, though only
one is in control at any time. What triggers the switch
from one personality to the other is highly variable and
depends on the individual. In general, stress is the most
common trigger, but the sudden appearance of a person,
object or situation can also serve as a trigger.
Each personality has its own set of mental Attributes (CRE,
INF, KNO, WIL, PSY) and its own Perks and Flaws. Ideally,
all personalities should have the same point cost, but the
Gamemaster may diverge from this in specific cases (if
needed for plot purposes, for example). Player and
Gamemaster should cooperate to create all the identities.
• THIN-SKINNED
The character has a low pain threshold, putting him out of
commission on even the lightest injuries. Thin-skinned
characters subtract five points from their Stamina and
recalculate their Damage Thresholds accordingly.
• WANTED
Somebody is currently chasing the character. Whether or not
this is justified, the character will have to face relentless, often
heavily armed pursuers that appear at the worst time
(Gamemaster’s choice). The player and the Gamemaster
should cooperate to define the hunters and the reason for
the hunt.
Wanted usually indicates a group hunting the character or
an individual doing so for professional reasons — a personal
enemy is covered by the Nemesis Flaw. Especially
masochistic players can combine Wanted and Nemesis (the
latter usually, but not always, being the leader of the hunter
group). Wanted’s potential upside is allies: others hunted by
the same group may be helpful while on the run.
• WEAK IMMUNE SYSTEM
Characters with a Weak Immune System are especially
vulnerable to diseases and the effects of drugs. These
characters get a -1 penalty to Health tests made against the
contagion and virulence of diseases, as well as the Potency
of a drug or toxin (seeDisease, section 6.3). A Weak Immune
System has no inherent upside other than the fact that the
character will also be less resistant to beneficial drugs such
as analgesics.
