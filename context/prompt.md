# Plan for Creating A Character Creation Application for the Silhouette CORE rules system for Jovian Chronicles the RPG

## Summary

Looking at the existing implementation in the previously provided documents (including the `directory-structre.txt` file), there are comprehensive elements that need to be integrated into our current implementation. Here's a plan for incorporating these statistics:

## 1. Core Attribute Management

### Ensure that:

UI elements for primary attributes (AGI, APP, BLD, etc.)
JavaScript logic to calculate point costs for attributes
Event handlers for attribute adjustments are handled.

Always use a modular structure when possible, isolating concerns as that makes sense.

Reduce the state-based issues that might arise from load order, or changes in state introduced by user-action (particularly "update loops" where changes to fundamental values require a recalculation of secondary attributes)

### Integration Plan

Consider whterh the moduler structure in attributeManager.js is a sufficient model, given the need to:

- Track Character Points used/available
- Implement attribute cost calculations (1, 4, 9, 16 points)
- Provide methods for increasing/decreasing attributes
- Calculate the effects on secondary traits when attributes change

Would the interface benefit from a tabbed display approach? If so, consider adding tabs to the existing interface in order to achieve a cleaner UI display

Use a card layout styling for the character data. Minimize it's impact on the screen real estate, but remember to allow for future optimiuzations like custom user avatars, easy editing of bcharacter name, and description fields for characters. Reference current the current implementation and the web for ideas.

## 2. Secondary Traits Calculation

### Ensure that:

Calculation logic for derived stats (STR, HEA, STA, etc.) happens in a state-safe manner.

The UI for displaying secondary traits is clear and "clustered" close to the primary attributes without "crowding"

They update in "real-time" when primary attributes change

### Integration Plan

Extend the attribute management code to include:

- Functions for all secondary trait calculations
- Methods to recalculate all traits when attributes change
- Event subscription system so UI can update when traits change

Add a Secondary Traits section to the character sheet
Implement formula displays that show how each trait is calculated

## 3. Character Sheet Integration

### Ensure that:

The app uses a unified character data structure that includes:

- Attributes
- Secondary traits
- Skills, perks, and flaws
- Character metadata

### Integration Plan

- Create a character data module that acts as a central data store
- Refactor existing skill manager to work with this central store
- Create an attribute manager that also uses this central store
- Implement an observer pattern so all UI components update when data changes

## 4. Extended UI Components

### Ensure that:

- Card layout for character overview
- Portrait/icon selection
- Faction selection UI and effects

### Integration Plan

- Create a new UI component for the character card
- Implement file upload for character portraits
- Add faction selection that affects relevant skills or attributes
- Implement a tabbed interface for switching between attributes, skills, and character information

## 5. Complete Save/Load Functionality

### Ensure that:

Saving/loading for attributes and secondary traits
Character export/import with complete data

### Integration Plan

Extend existing save/load functionality to include all character data
Add character export to JSON file option
Implement character import from JSON option
Add validation to ensure imported characters match system constraints

## 6. Technical Implementation Details

### Ensure that:

#### Modular Approach

Keep existing skills management separate but connected through the central data store
Use ES6 modules with clear interfaces between components

#### Event-Based Updates

- When attributes change -> recalculate secondary traits
- When skills like "Hand-to-hand" change -> update relevant secondary traits (e.g., Unarmed Damage)

#### Performance Considerations

- Use memoization for expensive calculations
- Batch UI updates to prevent excessive renders

#### Code Organization:

/js - Business logic (attribute manager, skill manager, etc.)
/js - UI components (attribute UI, skills UI, character card UI, etc.)
/js - Helper functions
/data/ - Data structures and storage management
/css - Styles
/assets - upload (non-database, etc.)

## 7. Implementation Timeline

- Phase 1: Implement attribute management and basic UI
- Phase 2: Implement secondary trait calculations
- Phase 3: Integrate with skills system
- Phase 4: Implement full character sheet UI with card layout
- Phase 5: Complete save/load functionality
- Phase 6: Testing and refinement
